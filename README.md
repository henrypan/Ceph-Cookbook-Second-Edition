Ceph is a unified distributed storage system designed for reliability and scalability.

Ceph is backed by Red Hat and has been developed by community of developers which has gained immense traction in recent years.

This book will guide you right from the basics of Ceph , such as creating blocks, object storage, and filesystem access, to advanced concepts such as cloud integration solutions.
